RetailCo - Exchanges Policy

Effective date: 2025-01-01

1. Overview
RetailCo permits exchanges for size or color changes within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery, subject to stock availability and the conditions set forth herein. Exchanges aim to provide customers with the nearest suitable replacement product; if the requested variant is unavailable, store credit or refund options are offered.

2. Eligibility & Process
- Exchanges require that the original item be returned in accordance with the Returns & Refunds Policy, and include a valid Return Authorization (RA).
- Upon receipt and inspection of the returned item, RetailCo will process an exchange by shipping the replacement item to the customer. Shipping fees for exchanges depend on the customer's location and any promotional allowances in effect at the time of purchase.
- If the requested size or color is not available, the customer may opt for store credit, a different replacement, or a refund.

3. Timing & Availability
- Exchanges are subject to product availability. RetailCo does not guarantee immediate stock for replacement items.
- For expedited exchanges, customers should contact support to request priority handling; additional fees may apply.

4. Special Conditions
- Customized or personalized items are not eligible for exchanges unless the exchange is due to a manufacturing defect.
- Seasonal or limited-edition items may have restricted exchange options.

5. International Exchanges
- International customers should check local country terms for exchange shipping costs and import/export regulations; taxes or duties incurred during exchange shipments may be the responsibility of the customer unless otherwise stated.

6. Fraud Prevention & Abuse
- RetailCo reserves the right to deny exchanges for patterns of abuse (excessive returns/exchanges) and may limit privileges or require additional verification.
