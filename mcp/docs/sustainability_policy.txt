RetailCo - Sustainability & Materials Policy

1. Commitment
RetailCo is committed to sustainable sourcing and reducing environmental impact across product lifecycle, including materials, production, packaging, and logistics.

2. Materials & Certifications
- We prioritize organic, recycled, and responsibly-sourced fibers where feasible.
- Supplier certifications (e.g., GOTS, OEKO-TEX) are sought for relevant product lines.

3. Packaging
- Minimal, recyclable packaging is used for standard shipments. Where possible, we use recycled materials for packing slips and labels.

4. End-of-life & Takeback
- RetailCo may run periodic takeback programs to encourage recycling or responsible disposal of garments. Program terms will be announced separately.
